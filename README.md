# Snake Game [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20discord-blue.svg)](https://discord.gg/a5TbcCeuJY)

This is a 2d game made from scratch in java with native tools.
It is made as a form of practice to create games natively, without any game engine.

You can compile the game using **grandle**, this will leave you with a **.jar** file in the **build/libs** folder
`./grandlew clean build`

Then run the **.jar** using the following command

`java -jar path/to/build/libs/SnakeGame-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

or

`./grandlew run`

You can also download the [executable](https://github.com/jjprintf/Snake/releases/tag/v1.0)
